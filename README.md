## PblPom: a[nother] productivity timer for the Pebble watch

This is a customizable, multilingual, simple, and attractive work timer. You
can use it with the Pomodoro Technique® or other time management systems.
The use of vibration means you can use your timers without worrying about
disturbing others, or having it drowned out by your music.

Current languages include English, Spanish, French, German, and Russian†.
We are looking for translators. Adding a language is easy! Fork the repository,
add your language to the `PomLanguage` enum in `pom_text.h`, and add an entry in
your language for every text key in `pom_text.c`. Submit a pull request.
